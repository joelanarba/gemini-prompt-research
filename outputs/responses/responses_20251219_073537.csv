Now, imagine a special light switch that can be ON, OFF, or BOTH at the SAME TIME! That's kind of like what a quantum computer uses. Instead of regular bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use ""quantum bits,"" called **qubits**.

These qubits can be 0, 1, or a mix of both at the same time. This lets quantum computers try many possibilities all at once, making them super fast for some problems.

It's like having many regular computers working together to solve a puzzle!
